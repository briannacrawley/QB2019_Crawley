  I'm a second year EEB student in Heather Reynolds lab. I'm currently involved with a collaborative project with IUPUI focusing on the Pleasant Run waterway; my goal is to determine the impacts of nutrient input from the city's combined sewer outflow system, as well herbivore pressure, on invasive plant established along the wateray corridor. I have a Boston terrier named Izzy and a ball python named Houdini. I enjoy reading, cooking and hiking. 
  My expectations for the course are to become familiar with using R and Git to manipulate and analyze data, and generally improve my quantitative skills. I'd like to be able to apply the skills gained in this course to my own research.
